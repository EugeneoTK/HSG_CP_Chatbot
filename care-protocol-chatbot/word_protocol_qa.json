Hence, offer patients with possible or definite Type 1 DM a referral to a specialist to make a recommendation on the therapy regimen.\nSeek guidance from the primary Endocrinologist of the enrollee for the individualised medications for clinical management. All enrolees with Type 1 DM must receive insulin. Multiple daily injections (3 or more), or the use of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion may be required to achieve target glucose levels.\n Patients with Type 1 DM should have thyroid function checked every 1-2 years, beyond the regular assessments recommended for patients with Type 2 DM."

In those without risk factors, testing should begin at 40 years. Those between 18-39 years old can consider doing the Diabetes Risk Assessment Tool (DRAT) in Health Hub Website [https://www.healthhub.sg/programmes/DRA] or on Healthhub app to assess their risk of getting Diabetes. Those who have been found to be high risk using the DRAT assessment should undergo formal blood test screening. \nDiabetes Screening (5\n3.
